        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Creole Seasoning</li>
            <li>Chicken Broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Season Chicken</h4>
                <p>Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Bake Chicken</h4>
                <p>Place the seasoned chicken in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about 10 minutes, then flip and continue to bake for about 15 more minutes (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is done baking, transfer it to a plate.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Finish with Pan Sauce</h4>
                <p>Pour the chicken broth into the pan you used to bake the chicken. Scrape any browned bits off the side with a spatula. Drizzle the pan sauce over the baked chicken before serving.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>How Long to Bake Chicken Breasts</h4>
                <p>It depends on the size of the chicken breasts. Smaller chicken breasts will bake in a shorter amount of time, while larger breasts will take a bit longer. If you use the 5-ounce breasts the recipe calls for, the chicken should be ready after about 25 minutes in the pre-heated oven. When the chicken is done, the juices will run clear and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.
